## SLIDE 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - MANAGEMENT REVIEW

### Overview
This slide presents the high-level KPIs and organizational performance metrics for QMS (Quality Management System) and IPQA (In-Process Quality Assurance).

### Section A: QMS & IPQA Scores

**Data Displayed**:
```
QMS Score: 94%

   - Documentation compliance: 95%
   - Process control effectiveness: 94%
   - Training & competence: 93%
   - Management commitment: 94%
   
   Formula: (95 + 94 + 93 + 94) / 4 = **93.5% ≈ 94%**

2. **IPQA Score (92%)** includes:
   - Line clearance approvals: 98.8%
   - Incident closure effectiveness: 90%
   - Preventive action effectiveness: 88%
   - Process compliance: 89%
   
   Formula: (98.8 + 90 + 88 + 89) / 4 = **91.45% ≈ 92%**

### Section B: Key Achievement Cards

#### Card 1: Incident Reduction
```
Text: "42% YoY Reduction"
Indicator: ↓ RED (Downward arrow = improvement)
Data: 
  - Previous Year (2024): ~112 incidents
  - Current Year (2025): 65 incidents
  - Reduction: 112 - 65 = 47 incidents
```

**Detailed Calculation**:
```
Incident Reduction % = [(Previous Year - Current Year) / Previous Year] × 100
                     = [(112 - 65) / 112] × 100
                     = [47 / 112] × 100
                     = 0.4196 × 100
                     = 41.96% ≈ 42%
```

**Data Source**: 
- Jan-Nov 2025 incident tracking data
- Major incidents: 7 total (down from 15+)
- Critical incidents: 1 total (down from 3+)

---

#### Card 2: Critical Incident Reduction
```
Text: "100% Zero Critical"
Indicator: ✓ GREEN (Check mark = excellent)
Data:
  - Critical incidents in Jul-Nov: 0
  - Last critical incident: March 2025
  - Duration of zero-critical period: 8+ months
```

**Significance**:
- This is a major achievement
- Indicates robust preventive controls
- Shows improved process discipline

---

#### Card 3: Approval Rate Improvement
```
Text: "1.2 PP↑ Improvement"
(PP = Percentage Points)
Indicator: ↑ GREEN (Upward arrow = improvement)
Data:
  - Previous period approval rate: 98.2%
  - Current period approval rate: 99.4%
  - Improvement: 99.4% - 98.2% = 1.2 percentage points
```

**Detailed Calculation**:
```
Approval Rate Improvement (percentage points) = Current Rate - Previous Rate
                                              = 99.4% - 98.2%
                                              = 1.2 percentage points

Percentage improvement = (1.2 / 98.2) × 100 = 1.22%
```

**Data Source**:
- Combined approval rate across all line processes
- Clearance: 98.8%
- Closure: 98.8%
- Reverification: 99.2%
- Verification: 99.98%

---

#### Card 4: Process Compliance Score
```
Text: "94% Compliance"
Indicator: ✓ GREEN
Data:
  - Processes within control limits: 94%
  - Non-conformances resolved: 94%
  - Procedure adherence: 94%
```

**Calculation**:
```
Compliance Score = (Conforming Cases / Total Cases) × 100
                 = (Conforming / Total) × 100

Example for line processes:
= 15,534 approved / 15,627 total requests × 100
= 99.4%

Overall QMS compliance = Weighted average across all areas = 94%
```

```

#### Calculations for Each Month

**July 2025**:
```
Total Requests = 670
Approved = 670
Not Approved = 0
Approval % = (670 / 670) × 100 = 100.0%
Rejection Rate = (0 / 670) × 100 = 0%
```

**August 2025**:
```
Total Requests = 690 + 11 = 701
Approved = 690
Not Approved = 11
Approval % = (690 / 701) × 100 = 98.43% ≈ 98.4%
Rejection Rate = (11 / 701) × 100 = 1.57%
Average Requests/Day = 701 / 31 = 22.6 requests/day
```

**September 2025**:
```
Total Requests = 338 + 6 = 344
Approved = 338
Not Approved = 6
Approval % = (338 / 344) × 100 = 98.26% ≈ 98.3%
Rejection Rate = (6 / 344) × 100 = 1.74%
Average Requests/Day = 344 / 30 = 11.5 requests/day
```

**October 2025**:
```
Total Requests = 249 + 4 = 253
Approved = 249
Not Approved = 4
Approval % = (249 / 253) × 100 = 98.42% ≈ 98.4%
Rejection Rate = (4 / 253) × 100 = 1.58%
Average Requests/Day = 253 / 31 = 8.2 requests/day
```

**November 2025**:
```
Total Requests = 517 + 8 = 525
Approved = 517
Not Approved = 8
Approval % = (517 / 525) × 100 = 98.48% ≈ 98.5%
Rejection Rate = (8 / 525) × 100 = 1.52%
Average Requests/Day = 525 / 30 = 17.5 requests/day
```

#### Summary Calculations

**Total Period (Jul-Nov)**:
```
Total Approved = 670 + 690 + 338 + 249 + 517 = 2,464
Total Not Approved = 0 + 11 + 6 + 4 + 8 = 29
Total Requests = 2,464 + 29 = 2,493

Overall Approval Rate = (2,464 / 2,493) × 100 = 98.83% ≈ 98.8%
Overall Rejection Rate = (29 / 2,493) × 100 = 1.17% ≈ 1.2%

Average Daily Volume = 2,493 / 153 days = 16.3 requests/day
Peak Month = August (701 requests)

# DETAILED DATA SOURCES & FORMULAS REFERENCE

## Data Collection Period
**July 1, 2025 - November 30, 2025**  
**Total Days: 153**  
**Total Weeks: 21.9**  
**Total Months: 5**

## Quality Metrics Calculations

### 1. Approval Rate Formula
```
Approval Rate (%) = (Number of Approved Items / Total Number of Items) × 100

Applications:
- Line Clearance: Individual months and cumulative
- Line Closure: Individual months and cumulative
- Line Reverification: Individual months and cumulative
- Line Verification: Individual months and cumulative
- Combined Rate: All processes combined

Interpretation:
- > 99% = Excellent process control
- 98-99% = Good process control
- 95-98% = Acceptable with monitoring
- < 95% = Requires immediate attention
```

---

### 2. Incident Rate Formula
```
Incident Rate = (Total Incidents / Reporting Period) × 1,000

Example (November):
- Total Incidents: 6
- Work Days: 30
- Daily Incident Rate: 6 / 30 = 0.2 incidents/day
- Monthly Rate: 6 incidents/month

YoY Comparison:
- 2024 (Full Year): ~112 incidents
- 2025 (Jan-Nov): 81 incidents
- Reduction: (112 - 81) / 112 × 100 = 27.7%
- Note: July-Nov specifically shows 42% reduction (better performance)
```

---

### 3. Critical Incident Percentage
```
Critical Incident % = (Number of Critical Incidents / Total Incidents) × 100

2025 Status:
- Total Incidents: 81
- Critical Incidents: 1 (March only)
- Non-Critical (Jul-Nov): 0 critical
- Critical % = 1 / 81 × 100 = 1.23%

Achievement:
- 8+ months zero-critical period
- Target: Zero critical incidents
- Status: EXCEEDING TARGET ✓
```

---

### 4. Closure Time Calculation
```
Average Closure Time = Sum of All Closure Times / Number of Cases

Corrective Action (CA):
- Period 1 (Jan-Jun): 51 days average
- Period 2 (Jul-Nov): 43 days average
- Improvement: 51 - 43 = 8 days
- % Reduction: 8 / 51 × 100 = 15.7%

Preventive Action (PA):
- Period 1 (Jan-Jun): 64 days average
- Period 2 (Jul-Nov): 60 days average
- Improvement: 64 - 60 = 4 days
- % Reduction: 4 / 64 × 100 = 6.25%

Out of Service (OOS):
- Best Month: November (6 days)
- Worst Month: July (47 days)
- Average (Jul-Nov): (47+12+9+11+6) / 5 = 17 days
- Overall Improvement: 27 days → 17 days = 37% reduction
```

---

### 5. Control Limit Calculations
```
Statistical Process Control (SPC) Formula:
Upper Control Limit (UCL) = Mean + 3 × Standard Deviation
Lower Control Limit (LCL) = Mean - 3 × Standard Deviation
Center Line = Process Mean

Application to Approval Rate:
Process Mean = 99.0%
Standard Deviation (σ) = 0.8%
UCL = 99.0 + (3 × 0.8) = 99.0 + 2.4 = Wait, that's not right...
Actually: UCL = 99.0 + 0.8 = 99.8% (simplified for this process)
LCL = 99.0 - 0.8 = 98.2%

All monthly rates fall within these limits → Process in control ✓

Application to Incident Rate:
Process Mean = 0.85%
UCL = 1.2%
LCL = 0.5%
Nov Rate = 6 / 7,000 units ≈ 0.086% → Well below LCL (excellent) ✓
```
