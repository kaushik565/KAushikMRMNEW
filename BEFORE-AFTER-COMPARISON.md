## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- **Bold section headers** with color gradients draw attention
- **Metric values** in larger fonts (1.8em-2.2em)
- **Labels** in smaller fonts (0.65em-0.85em)

### 2. Color Psychology
- **Purple** for manufacturing (authority, quality)
- **Green** for cartridge (success, completion)
- **Orange** for sampling (caution, testing)

### 3. Whitespace & Spacing
- 32-40px margins between sections
- 14-18px padding within cards
- 12px gaps between elements
- Prevents visual clutter

### 4. Consistency
- All cards use same corner radius (10-14px)
- All badges follow same styling pattern
- All hover effects use same timing (0.3s ease)
- All shadows follow same formula

### 5. Accessibility
- High contrast text (99% contrast)
- Color + text labels (not color alone)
- Large touch targets for mobile
- Clear focus states

### 6. Responsiveness
- Grid layouts use `auto-fit minmax()`
- Cards stack on mobile
- Font sizes scale appropriately
- Touch-friendly spacing

## User Experience Improvements

### Executive Viewing
**Before**: Required reading through sections to understand status
**After**: Dashboard header provides instant overview with 4 key metrics

### Detailed Review
**Before**: Cards run together; hard to distinguish sections
**After**: Clear section separators; color themes help identify content

### Mobile Viewing
**Before**: Cards overflow; cramped layout
**After**: Responsive grid; stacks properly on smaller screens

### Data Reference
**Before**: Hard to find specific metrics
**After**: Quick scan of color-coded sections; metrics clearly labeled
