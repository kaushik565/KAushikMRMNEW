## Calculations Methodology

### Line Process Approval Rate Formula

```
Approval Rate (%) = (Approved Requests / Total Requests) × 100

Example (Line Clearance - July):
= (670 / 670) × 100 = 100%

Example (Line Clearance - August):
= (690 / 701) × 100 = 98.4%

Combined Rate (All Processes):
= (15,534 / 15,627) × 100 = 99.40%
```

---

### Incident Reduction Calculation

```
YoY Reduction (%) = (Previous Year Total - Current Year Total) / Previous Year Total × 100

Example:
Previous Year Total (2024): ~112 incidents
Current Year Total (2025): 65 incidents
Reduction = (112 - 65) / 112 × 100 = 42%
```

---

### Average Days to Closure

```
Average = Sum of All Closure Times / Number of Cases

Example (CA - Jul-Nov):
Total Days = 43 × (number of CAs)
Average = Total Days / Number of CAs

Or using period averages:
Average = (51 + 43) / 2 = 47 days (overall comparison)
```

---

### Process Improvement Calculation

```
Improvement (%) = (Old Value - New Value) / Old Value × 100

Example (OOS Closure):
= (27 - 17) / 27 × 100 = 37% improvement

Example (CA Closure):
= (51 - 43) / 51 × 100 = 15.7% improvement
```

---

### Control Limit Calculation (Statistical Process Control)

```
Process Mean = Average of all measurements
Standard Deviation (σ) = measure of variation
Upper Control Limit = Mean + 3σ
Lower Control Limit = Mean - 3σ

Example (Approval Rate):
Mean = 99.0%
UCL = 99.0 + 0.8 = 99.8%
LCL = 99.0 - 0.8 = 98.2%
```

---

## Summary of Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Overall Approval Rate** | 99.40% | ✓ Excellent |
| **YoY Incident Reduction** | 42% | ✓ Excellent |
| **Critical Incidents** | 0 | ✓ Excellent |
| **CA Closure Time** | 43 days | ✓ Good (15.7% improvement) |
| **PA Closure Time** | 60 days | ✓ Good (6.25% improvement) |
| **OOS Resolution Time** | 17 days avg | ✓ Good (37% improvement) |
| **Process Compliance** | 94% | ✓ Good |
| **Line Verifications** | 99.98% approval | ✓ Excellent |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Control**: Continue current processes as all metrics are within control limits
2. **Sustain Zero-Critical**: Keep focus on prevention to maintain zero critical incidents
3. **Further OOS Optimization**: Target <10 days average OOS resolution time
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed incident records for trend analysis
5. **Training**: Continue quality awareness training given the excellent metrics achieved
